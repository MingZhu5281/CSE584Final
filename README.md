https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pxm7_-M4s6ygUYinye24H0nI1a0N3je831xULYvl2jE/edit?usp=sharing

My experimental columns: (personally added last two columns)

| Discipline | Question | Reason you think it is faulty | Which top LLM you tried | Response by the top LLM | Original correct question | Faulty Reason Type |

See data100.csv for 100 rows of data, which merged all subjects and shuffled.
